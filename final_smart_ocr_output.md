(v) "This being the first issue of the issuer, there has been no formal market for the securities of the issuer. The face value of the 
securities is Taka 10.00 (ten) and the issue price is Tk. 10 i.e. ‘1 times’ of the face value. The issue price as determined should not 
be  taken  to  be  indicative  of  the  market  price  of  the  securities  after  listing.  No  assurance  can  be  given  regarding  an  active  or 
sustained trading of the securities or the price after listing." 

(vi) "Investment in securities involves a degree of risk and investors should not invest any funds in this offer unless they can afford 
to take the  risk of losing their investment. Investors are advised to read the risk factors carefully before  making an invest ment 
decision in this offer. For making an investment decision, investors must rely on their own examination of the issuer and the offer 
including the risks involved. Given the emerging nature of small capital companies, there may be a higher investment risk attached 
to the securities being offered. The securities to be traded on the Small Capital (SME) Platform may be more susceptible to high 
market volatility than securities traded on the Main Board and no assurance is given that there will be an active market for trading 
of such securities. The securities have not been recommended by the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (BSEC) nor

SECTION I: RISK FACTORS AND MANAGEMENT’S PERCEPTION ABOUT THE RISKS 

7 

 
 
 
(a) Interest rate risks 

Interest  rate  risk  concerned  with  borrowed  funds  of  short  term  and  long-term  maturity,  volatility  of  money 
market, which ultimately influences the interest rate structure of fund. 

Management perception: 

Brain Station 23 PLC is not exposed to fluctuations in interest rates as it has no short-term or long-term interest-
bearing debt. The Company relies on internally generated cash and/or equity financing to meet its obligations.  

(b) Exchange rate risks 

Devaluation of local currency against major international currencies i.e. USD, GBP and Euro may affect company’s 
income. 

Management perception: 

The management of Brain Station 23 PLC is aware that the local currency BDT is facing downward pressure from 
USD and other major currencies. Most of the revenue earned by Brain Station 23 PLC is through export of services 
and the company also settles import payments through foreign currency. Depreciation of BDT for exports receipts 
will  be  favorable  for  the  Company  and  unfavorable  for  import  payments.  Overall,  as  the  export  earnings  is 
significantly higher compared to import payments, the current devaluation of BDT is favorable for the Company.  

(c) Industry risks 

Industry risk refers to factors that can impact a specific industry and the companies operating under it. Industry’s 
risk factors can affect business growth, profitability, and sustainability. 

Management perception: 

Worldwide the demand for IT solutions is increasing as businesses are striving to increase efficiency and reduce 
operational cost to remain competitive and improve profitability. The management of Brain Station 23 PLC believes 
that the demand for IT driven solutions both in the domestic market and abroad will increase. As the cost of labor 
in Bangladesh is very competitive, the export of IT solutions and software will thrive. As the IT and software sector 
is growing fast, exposure of industry risk is low.  

(d) Market and technology-related risks 

Market and Technology risk is a type of business risk defined as any market and technological changes that may 
disrupt the business. 

Management perception: 

Brain Station 23 PLC stay updated with the latest and the most innovative technologies to remain competitive in 
the global market. The Company engages in research and development as part of management’s commitment to 
enhance client  satisfaction  and  complete challenging projects,  with  innovative  and  cutting-edge  solutions.  The 
company regularly arranges training to keep their employees up to date with all technological developments.  

(e) Potential or existing government regulations 

Companies of Bangladesh operates under various laws like Companies Act, 1994, taxation related laws and rules, 
rules of Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission etc. Any abrupt changes of the policies formed by those 
bodies may impact on the business of the company adversely. 

Management perception: 

As the government considers the ICT and software as priority or thrust sector, the management believes it is highly 
unlikely that the government will initiate any measure having adverse effect on the industry.  

(f) Potential changes in global or national policies 

The performance of companies may be affected by the political and economic instability both in Bangladesh and 
worldwide. Any instance of political turmoil and disturbance in the country may adversely affect the economy in 
general. 

8 

 
Management perception: 

The risk due to changes in global or national policies is beyond the control of any company. Yet the Company is 
well prepared to adopt new policies and measures as and when required to reduce such risks. Furthermore, political 
unrest due to strikes and mass protests may have a negative impact on any business. However, as the Company 
provides IT solutions and software to clients and delivery of such nature of services may face little obstruction.  

(g) History of non-operation 

History  of  non-operation  indicates  weak  operational  management  of  the  Company.  Non-operation  leads  to 
negative cash flow, incurring of losses and bankruptcy in worst case scenario. 

Management perception: 

Brain Station 23 PLC has no history of non-operation in the past. It has experienced directors and a management 
team  to  make  the  Company  more  efficient  and  competitive.  So,  the  chance  of  becoming  non-operative  of  the 
Company is very less.  

(h) Operational risks 

Operational risk is the risk of losses caused by flawed or failed processes, policies, systems or events that disrupt 
business operations. Employee errors, criminal activity such as fraud and physical events are among the factors 
that can trigger operational risk. 

Management perception: 

The  Company  manages  its  operational  risk  by  incorporating  strong  internal  control  by  identifying,  assessing, 
monitoring, controlling, and mitigating operational related risks. The Company also applies additional procedures 
necessary  to  comply  with  regulatory  requirements.  The  Company  has  strong  risk  management  procedures  to 
manage the operational risks.  

(i) Risk relating to secondary trading of securities 

In the primary market, the issue price of Brain Station 23 PLC is determined based on applicable law and may not 
be indicative of the market price in the secondary market. 

Management perception: 

The market price of shares is subject to systematic risk which may affect the price adversely.

SECTION XIV: DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE 

55

(a) If ordinary shares are being offered, the factors to be considered in determining the offering price shall be 
set forth in the prospectus 

Qualitative factors: 

1.  Brain  Station  23  is  one  of  the  leading  software  development  and  IT  consulting  company  in  Bangladesh 
specializing in innovative solutions and digital transformation. Offering a  wide range of services, including 
custom software development, web and mobile app development, and cutting-edge technology consulting. 
The company with 17 years of experience since its inception in 2006, serves over 300 global and domestic 
clients across diverse industries. It specializes in agile software development methodologies, enabling rapid 
adaptation and continuous improvement in projects. This agility allows clients to respond quickly to market 
changes. 

2.  Brain Station 23 is pioneering Digital Solutions in IT and Software Development Sector. In 2017, the company 
developed  the  First  in-country  mobile  app  (City  Touch)  and  in  2022  the  company  crosses  USD  10  Mn  in 
revenue and its Managing Director & CEO Mr. Raisul Kabir became Top 20 young business leaders in South 
Asia. 

3. 

In  the  past  two  years,  Brain  Station  23  has  delivered  an  exceptional  81%  growth  in  revenue.  Europe  and 
America  have  been  the  primary  drivers  of  this  growth,  with  staggering  growth  rates  of  174%  and  222%, 
respectively, during this period. This growth has led to a substantial increase in the percentage of revenue 
contributed  by  Europe  and  America.  Europe's  contribution  has  significantly  expanded,  indicating  a  strong 
foothold in the European market.  

4.  The company currently relies on local revenue for one-third of its income, but it aims to reduce this to 24% 
over the next five years, aligning with its global expansion strategy. The company is actively pursuing new 
foreign  clients  in  Finland,  Spain,  New  Zealand,  Austria,  Saudi  Arabia,  and  Malaysia.  This  strategic  move  is 
expected  to  boost  revenue  in  the  Asian  and  Oceania  regions,  aligning  with  the  company's  broader  global 
expansion objectives.

(a) the financial statements prepared and audited in adherence to the provisions of the Securities and Exchange 
Rules, 2020 

Independent Auditor’s Report  
To the Shareholders of 
Brain Station 23 Ltd. 
Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements 

Opinion: 

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Brain Station 23 Ltd. (the Company), which comprise 
the Statement of Financial Position as at 30th  September 2023 and the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other 
Comprehensive Income, the  Statement of Cash Flows, and the Statement of Changes in Equity for the period 
then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. 

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the 
company as at 30th September 2023 and its financial performance and its cash flows for the period then ended 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). 

Basis for Opinion: 

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under 
those  standards  are  further  described  in  Auditor’s  Responsibilities  for  the  Audit  of  the  Financial  Statements 
section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the International Ethics Standards 
Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code), and we have fulfilled our ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh 
(ICAB) Bye Laws. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our opinion. 

Key Audit Matters: 

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of 
the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the 
financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon and  we do not provide a separate opinion 
on these matters. 

Revenue Recognition 

from 

Risk 
The  revenue  during  the  period  represents 
revenue  mainly 
software 
arising 
development,  web  hosting  and  IT  support.  We 
have identified the head ‘revenue’ as a key audit 
matter  because  revenue  is  one  of 
the  key 
performance  indicators  of  the  Company  and 
therefore there is an inherent risk of manipulation 
of  the  timing  of  recognition  of  revenue  by 
management to 
meet  specific  targets  or  expectations.  There 
is 
also  a  risk  that  revenue  may  be  overstated 
through misstatement of the measurement units. 
Further, there is a risk that the provisions of IFRS 
15  may  not  be  properly  complied  with.  The 
involves  certain  key 
application  of 
judgments  relating  to 
identification  of 
the 
distinct  performance  obligations,  determination 
of transaction  price of the identified performance 
obligation, the appropriateness of the basis used 
to  measure  revenue  recognized  over  a 
period. 
  Please see note # 20 to the financial statements. 

IFRS  15 

Our Response to the risk 

Our audit included the following procedures: 
•  We  tested  certain 
revenue  process 
calculation of the units invoiced for; 

internal  controls  within  the 
the 

including  controls  over 

•  We  checked  the  process  to  get  assurance  that 
revenue  has  been  recognized  at  the  correct  time 
by testing a sample of transactions against which the 
revenue has been recognized. 

•  We tested a sample of revenue which comprised 

and 

compared 

of  software  development  and  web  hosting  as  main 
underlying 
to 
components 
documentation, including the contracts. 
•  We critically assessed journals posted to revenue  to 
identify  unusual  or  irregular  items  and  obtained 
underlying documentation. 

We  ascertained  the  revenue  recognition  process  and 
tested  the  same  through  recalculation  of  revenue,  and 
evaluation of recognition, measurement, presentation and 
disclosures in the financial  statements  in  accordance  with 
the related IFRS 15.

Valuation of Property, Plant & Equipment 

Risk 
The carrying value of the PPE amounted to Tk. 
363,483,380  at  30  September  2023.  The 
valuation  of  PPE  was  identified  as  a  key  audit 
matter due to the significance of this balance to 
the financial statements. 
Expenditures are capitalized if they create new 
or enhance the existing assets, and expensed if 
they  relate  to  repair  or  maintenance  of  the 
assets.  Classification  of 
the  expenditures 
involves judgment. The useful lives of PPE items 
are  based  on  management’s  estimates 
regarding the period during which  the asset  or 
its  significant  components  will  be  used.  The 
estimates are based on historical experience and 
market practice and take into consideration the 
physical condition of the assets. 

Please see note # 4 to the financial statements. 

Our Response to the risk 

Our audit included the following procedures: 
•  We  assessed  whether  the  accounting  policies  in 
relation to the capitalization of expenditures are in 
compliance  with  IFRS  and  found  them  to  be 
consistent. 

•  We  obtained  a  listing  of  capital  expenditures 
incurred during the period and, on a sample  basis, 
checked whether the items were procured based 
on internal purchase order that had been properly 
approved by the responsible  individuals. 

•  We 

inspected  a  sample  of 

invoices  and  to 
determine  whether  the  classification  between 
capital 
expenditure  was 
appropriate. 

operating 

and 

•  We evaluated whether the useful lives determined 
and applied by the management  were in line with 
historical experience and the market practice. 
•  We checked  whether  the depreciation of  PPE items 
was commenced namely, by comparing the date  of 
the  reclassification  from  capital  in progress to ready 
for  use,  with  the  date  of  the  act of  completion  of 
the work. 

62 

 
 
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements: 

Management  is  responsible  for  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  that  give  a  true  and  fair  view 
in 
accordance with IFRSs, the Companies Act, 1994 and other applicable laws and regulations and for such internal 
control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

In  preparing  the  financial  statements,  management  is  responsible  for  assessing  the  Company’s  ability  to 
continue as a  going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going 
concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, 
or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process. 

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements: 

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditor’s report  that includes our 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 

As  part  of  an  audit  in  accordance  with  ISAs,  we  exercise  professional  judgment  and  maintain  professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also: 

• 

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or 
error, design  and perform audit procedures responsive to  those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is 
sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis  for  our  opinion.  The  risk  of  not  detecting  a  material 
misstatement  resulting  from  fraud  is  higher  than  for  one  resulting  from  error,  as  fraud  may  involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 

•  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing  an opinion on the effectiveness 
of the Company’s internal control. 

• 

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by management. 

•  Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based 
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that 
may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a 
material  uncertainty  exists,  we  are  required  to  draw  attention  in  our  auditor’s  report  to  the  related 
disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our 
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, 
future events or conditions may cause the Company’s to cease to continue as a going concern. 

• 

Evaluate  the  overall  presentation,  structure,  and  content  of  the  financial  statements, 
including  the 
disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a 
manner that gives a true and fair view. 

63 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we 
identify during our audit. 

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that 
may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. 

Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements 

In accordance with the Companies Act, 1994 and the Securities and Exchange Rules,2020, we also report the 
following: 

•  We have obtained all the information and explanation which to the best of our knowledge  and belief were 

necessary for the purpose of our audit and made due verification thereof; 

• 

• 

• 

In our opinion, proper books of account as required by law have been kept by the Company so far as it 
appeared from our examination of these books; and 

The statement of financial position and statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income dealt 
with by the report are in agreement with the books of accounts returns; and, 

The expenditure incurred was for the purposes of the Company’s business.

Property, plant and equipment 

3.01 
3.01.1  Recognition & measurement 

Property, plant and equipment are capitalized at the cost of acquisition and subsequently reported at cost 
less accumulated depreciation and impairment loss in compliance with the cost model of IAS 16 “Property, 
Plant  and  Equipment”.  The  cost  of  acquisition  of  an  asset  comprises  its  purchase  price  and  any  directly 
attributable  cost  of  bringing  the  assets  to  its  operating  condition  for  its  intended  use  inclusive  of  inward 
freight, duties and non-refundable taxes. 

3.01.2 

Subsequent cost 
Subsequent  costs  are  included  in  the  asset’s  carrying  amount  or  recognized  as  separate  assets,  as 
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the 
Company and the cost  of the item can be  measured reliably. All other  maintenance  costs are charged to 
income statement. 

70

3.01.3  Depreciation  

3.01.4 

Depreciation is charged on property, plant, and equipment (except land) using the reducing balance 
method of each item of property, plant, and equipment. Depreciation on addition to property, plant, 
and equipment is charged from the date when assets are put into use for commercial operation. No 
depreciation  is  charged  on  the  assets  from  the  month  on  which  such  assets  are  disposed. 
The rates of depreciation, ranging from 10% to 25% p.a. for the current period, are as follows: 

Depreciation rate (%):

Application of IFRS-16: Leases 
The Company assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the 
contract  conveys  the  right  to  control  the  use  of  an  identified  asset  for  a  period  in  exchange  for 
consideration. The Company applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, 
except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Company recognizes lease liabilities 
to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets. 

Right-of-use assets (RoU) 
The Company's policy is to recognize right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., 
the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any 
accumulated  depreciation  and  impairment  losses,  and  adjusted  for  any  remeasurement  of  lease 
liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized and lease 
payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. 

Lease liabilities 
At the commencement date of the lease, the Company recognizes lease liabilities measured at the 
present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed 
payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease 
payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value 
guarantees.  The  lease  payments  also  include  the  exercise  price  of  a  purchase  option  reasonably 
certain to be exercised by the Company and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the 
lease term reflects the Company exercising the option to terminate. 

When  measuring  lease  liability,  the  company  discounted  lease  payments  using  an  incremental 
borrowing rate at 6.50% p.a. 

After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of 
interest  and  reduced  for  the  lease  payments  made.  In  addition,  the  carrying  amount  of  lease 
liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease 
payments  (e.g.,  changes  to  future  payments  resulting  from  a  change  in  an  index  or  rate  used  to 
determine  such  lease  payments  or  a  change  in  the  assessment  of  an  option  to  purchase  the 
underlying asset. 
Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets 
The Company is not applying the recognition and measurement requirements of IFRS 16 to short-
term leases (leases of less than 12 months maximum duration). It also not applying the recognition 
and measurement requirements of IFRS 16 to leases for which the underlying asset is of low value 
(i.e. less than BDT 5,00,000 when new). Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value 
assets  are  recognized  as  expenses  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  lease  term  or  as  per  the 
agreement.

3.12 

Due to tax exemption facilities, the company does not incorporate deferred tax in compliance with IAS-12: 
Income taxes. 

Financial instruments 
(a) Financial assets 
The company initially recognizes receivables and deposits on the date that they are originated. All other 
financial  assets  are  recognized  initially  on  the  date  at  which  the  company  becomes  a  party  to  the 
contractual provisions of the transaction. The company derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual 
rights or probabilities of receiving cash flows from the assets expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the 
contractual cash flows on the financial asset in a transaction in which all the risks and rewards of ownership 
of the financial asset are transferred substantially. 

(b) Financial liabilities  
The company initially recognizes financial liabilities on the transaction date at which the company becomes 
a party to the contractual provisions of the liability. The company derecognizes a financial liability when its 
contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or expired. 

Impairment Financial assets 
The  Company  measures  loss  allowances  for  trade  receivables  at  an  amount  equal  to  lifetime  Expected 
Credit Loss (ECL). When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly 
since  initial  recognition  and when  estimating  ECLs,  the  Company  considers  reasonable  and  supportable 
information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and 
qualitative information and analysis, based on Brain Station 23 Ltd.'s historical experience and informed 
credit assessment and including forward-looking information. Lifetime ECLs are the ECLs that result from 
all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. The maximum period considered 
when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which Brain Station 23 Ltd. is exposed to 
credit risk. 

ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured by the cash shortfalls 
(i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash 
flows that the Company expects to receive). 

At each reporting date, the Company assesses whether financial assets carried at amortized cost and debt 
securities at FVOCI are credit-impaired. A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that 
have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. 

Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data: 
(a) significant financial difficulty of the debtor;  
(b) a breach of contract such as a 
default; 
(c) it is probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy. 

The  gross  carrying  amount  of  a  financial  asset  is  written  off  when  the  Company  has  no  reasonable 
expectations of recovering a financial asset in its entirely or a portion thereof.

3.13.1  Credit risk 

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterpart to a financial instrument fails to 
meet  its  contractual  obligation  which  arises  principally  from  the  Company's  receivables  from 
customers. 
The Company makes sales on advance basis i.e. it receives advance from customers prior to sale, so 
there is no credit risk due to uncollectibility from the customers. However, the Company maintains 
most of the financial assets with short-term deposits and cash and cash equivalents. 
The  carrying  amount  of  financial  assets  represents  the  maximum  credit  exposure.  The  maximum 
exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was: 

Financial assets 
Fixed deposits 
Trade receivables 
Cash and cash equivalents

Liquidity risk 
Liquidity  risk  is  the  risk  that  the  Company  may  encounter  difficulty  in  meeting  the  obligations 
associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or other financial assets.  
The Company's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have 
sufficient  liquidity  to  meet  its  liabilities  when  due,  under  both  normal  and  stressed  conditions, 
without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Company's reputation. 
The contractual maturities of financial liabilities of the Company are as follows:
